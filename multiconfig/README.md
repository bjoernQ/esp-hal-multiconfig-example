# Multi config example

If it is also need to target different chips, maybe even spanning different architectures see the "multitarget" example.

This is based on a project generated by [esp-generate](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-generate) and extends the generated project to include multiple configurations.

## .cargo

The regular `config.toml` now includes aliases for the different configurations. (e.g. `config-a`,`config-b` etc.).
This is just for convenience - otherwise the user would need to remember to pass the correct parameter to Cargo.

It will choose an individual `config_XXX.toml` which augments the configuration with specific settings.

Cargo will merge the base `config.toml` and the individual configs. (see https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html#hierarchical-structure and https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html#command-line-overrides)

To avoid confusion it's best to keep the whole `[env]` section in the individual config files.

This is especially true when using the esp-config TUI application to modify configs but also generally requires less reasoning about where a setting comes from.
